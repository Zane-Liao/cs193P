# cs193p
### Swift Dev
- Assignments only completed the required tasks.
- Some things in cs193p require a lot of hints, and I only finished the first three due to limited time.
- For today's App development, we are more concerned about the friendly interaction between architecture and module functions. I think that in addition to traditional computer science fields, such as compilers and large and complex systems such as operating systems, the rest, such as website development and App business, can all be Vibe Coding.
- However, vibe coding can lead to deviations if you do not have a deep understanding of the material. I think if you need to delve deeper into a field, you need to read a lot of documents and excellent program codes. You donâ€™t necessarily need to implement it from scratch, but reading, analyzing, and taking some notes are very necessary.
